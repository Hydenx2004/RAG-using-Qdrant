The Kingdom of Aetheria was known for its majestic towers, glowing flora, and the powerful Aether Crystal that maintained the balance of magic and reality. However, the kingdom mysteriously vanished from the annals of history, leaving only myths and legends.\\nOne fateful night, a young scholar named Elara, who lived in the humble village of Lumoria, discovered an ancient tome buried deep in the archives of her library. The tome spoke of a prophecy regarding the return of Aetheria and a chosen one who would restore its glory. The prophecy hinted at a hidden artifact, the Celestial Amulet, which could reveal the kingdom’s location.\\nChapter 2: The Quest Begins',\n",
              " 'Chapter 2: The Quest Begins\\nElara, driven by curiosity and a sense of destiny, embarked on her journey to find the Celestial Amulet. Her only companion was a talking fox named Rix, who had a knack for solving puzzles and navigating enchanted forests. They ventured into the Whispering Woods, a forest known for its shifting paths and magical illusions.\\nTheir first challenge was a riddle posed by the Forest Guardian, a wise old tree with a face carved into its trunk. The riddle led them to the heart of the forest, where they encountered a hidden chamber guarded by ancient wards. Using their combined wits, Elara and Rix deciphered the wards and uncovered a map leading to the Lost Isles, a cluster of floating islands that were rumored to be the resting place of the Celestial Amulet.\\nChapter 3: The Lost Isles',\n",
              " \"Chapter 3: The Lost Isles\\nElara and Rix traversed the skies in a magical airship, the Windrider, to reach the Lost Isles. Each island had its own set of challenges: one was plagued by fierce storms, another was home to a tribe of sky pirates, and a third was shrouded in an eternal fog.\\nOn the island of the sky pirates, Elara and Rix befriended a rogue pirate named Kael who had a map to the Celestial Amulet's resting place. Despite initial mistrust, Kael joined their quest after Elara and Rix helped him escape a band of rival pirates. Together, they navigated the fog-shrouded island and found the entrance to a hidden temple.\\nChapter 4: The Hidden Temple\\nInside the hidden temple, the trio faced numerous trials that tested their courage and unity. They encountered a labyrinth of illusions, ancient traps, and magical guardians. Each trial required a combination of strength, intelligence, and cooperation.\",\n",
              " \"At the temple’s core, they discovered the Celestial Amulet, but it was protected by a powerful enchantment. Elara, using the knowledge gained from the ancient tome, performed a ritual to break the enchantment. The amulet revealed a vision of the lost Kingdom of Aetheria, showing its location in the sky, hidden by powerful magic.\\nChapter 5: The Restoration\\nWith the Celestial Amulet in hand, Elara, Rix, and Kael used the amulet's power to locate and reveal the lost kingdom. They journeyed to the heart of the floating islands and performed a ritual to restore Aetheria to its former glory. As the kingdom reappeared, the Aether Crystal was found intact, glowing brightly and restoring balance to the realm.\",\n",
              " 'The people of Aetheria welcomed Elara, Rix, and Kael as heroes. Elara was honored for her bravery and wisdom, Rix was celebrated as a legendary guide, and Kael was offered a position of honor among the kingdom’s defenders. Together, they ensured the prosperity and peace of Aetheria, fulfilling the ancient prophecy.']"

This crystal, a powerful artifact said to be forged by the gods themselves, was lost to time, hidden in the depths of the Forbidden Mountains.\n",

However, the Crystal would not come until the heroes were given time (which would eventually end the world at the end of the world, where Elara would become an immortal, immortal being). That happened when two young ladies in different groups of girls discovered how the Crystal would eventually be released and bring them back to their parents, but the three of them could see their parents' dream was no longer enough until the children finally fell in love and reunited together.\n",

To fulfill the dream, they had to first summon the 'Demon King' to help her and her group defeat the other characters who were left behind. Elara and the other members of the Crystal had to fight against that 'Demon King' in order to get the Crystal. To help the heroes overcome that battle and bring back the magic (this was revealed to be the Crystal's true power), they also went on trial, and for the rest of their life had to compete with the other three for magic.\n",

She had taken her time to see and get out of there before the final battles were fought. All the soldiers except the 'Queen' would be left behind (since they lost their position) and all the other Crystal warriors (due to Elara and her group becoming so overwhelmed by the Crystal's power and suffering that they had to take care of them after their deaths) couldn't survive the final battle with the other Crystal Warriors.\n",

One by one, the Crystal Warriors died or became insane for a single moment, and the others would follow her to the end of the temple by the sea until death.
